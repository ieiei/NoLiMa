# NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching

This repository contains the code and data associated with our paper, "[NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167)".

## Abstract
> Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce **NoLiMa**, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have **minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack**. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts ($<$1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50\% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3\% to 69.7\%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.

This table presents the performance results of selected models on NOLIMA tests. The **base score** represents a model’s accuracy on the task at short contexts (250, 500, and 1K) and serves as a controlled reference to measure performance degradation at longer contexts. 
The **effective length** is defined as the longest context where a model maintains at least 85% of its base score. Scores above this threshold are <ins>underlined</ins>, while scores dropping below 50% of the base score are *italicized*.

#### ✨ Updates:

- [2025-04-10]: Added evaluation results on Gemma 3 models (4B/12B/27B), Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 4 Scout. (Llama 4.0 Maverick evaluation in progress... ⏳)

## Model Evaluation Instructions

Below are the general steps to evaluate models, whether serving them locally or using an API-based service.

---
### 1. Installing Requirements
Install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Downloading Data
Download the NoLiMa dataset by running:
```bash
data/download_NoLiMa_data.sh
```
The needle set and haystack data will be downloaded to the `data` directory from our [HuggingFace Datasets 🤗](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amodaresi/NoLiMa) repository.

### 3A. Locally Served Models

1. **Start the model server (optional)**  
   - For example, to serve the Meta Llama 3.3 (70B) model across 8 GPUs:  
     ```bash
     evaluation/vllm_serve.sh --model_name meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct --num_gpus 8
     ```
   - This script uses a tensor parallel configuration by default. Modify it as needed.

2. **Create or modify a local model configuration**  
   - Use `llama_3.3_70b.json` in the `evaluation/model_configs` folder as a reference.
   Note that this configuration file is used in the evaluation script (not for the vllm serve).

### 3B. API-Based Models

- **Create or modify a model configuration for your API-based service**  
  - For example, use the existing config templates in the `evaluation/model_configs` folder.  
  - Note that some APIs may require additional credentials or authentication (AWS, Google Auth, etc.).

### 4. Common Steps for Both Approaches

1. **Prepare test configuration files**  
   - Add or modify configuration files in the `evaluation/run_config` directory.  
   - Ensure they reference the correct model config file from `evaluation/model_configs`.

2. **Run the evaluations**  
   ```bash
   evaluation/run_tests.sh
   ```
3. **Collect the results**
    - All outputs are automatically saved to the results directory specified in each run_config file.
4. **Gathering the results**
    - Using the `evaluation/gather_results.ipynb` notebook, you can easily gather the results from the output files and generate a csv file containing the accuracy of each test.

### Additional Notes
You can find various needle sets (e.g., CoT-style, multiple choice, direct, distractor-included) in `data/needlesets`.
Adjust any paths or configurations as needed for your specific environment.

## Haystack Filtering Pipeline

To replicate our evaluation results, you can directly use the shuffled texts available in the `data/haystack/rand_shuffle` directory. If you prefer to generate your own shuffled texts or run the full processing pipeline from scratch, refer to the `data/README.md` file for more information.
